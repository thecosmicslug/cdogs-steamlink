	"Description": "Captured in your attempt to grab the secret plans, you were taken to the Nazi prison Castle Wolfenstein for questioning and eventual execution. Now for twelve long days you've been imprisoned beneath the castle fortress. Just beyond your cell door sits a lone thick-necked Nazi guard. He assisted an SS Dentist / Mechanic in an attempt to jump start your tonsils earlier that morning. You're at your breaking point! Quivering on the floor you beg for medical assistance in return for information. His face hints a smug grin of victory as he reaches for his keys. He opens the door, tumblers in the lock echo through the corridors and the door squeaks open. HIS MISTAKE!\n\nA single kick to his knee sends him to the floor. Giving him your version of the victory sign, you grab his knife and quickly finish the job. You stand over the guard's fallen body, grabbing frantically for his gun. You're not sure if the other guards heard his muffled scream. Deep in the belly of a Nazi dungeon, you must escape. This desperate act has sealed your fate-get out or die trying.",
